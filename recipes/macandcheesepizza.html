    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This homemade mac and cheese pizza is the best pizza ever! This 
      is the basic recipe — add your favorite flavors, such as bacon, 
      onion, Havarti cheese, or Gruyère cheese.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup milk or as needed</li>
      <li>12 ounces processed cheese (such as Velveeta), cubed</li>
      <li>1 (11 ounce) package refrigerated pizza crust</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a 
        10x15-inch baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook 
        elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until 
        cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
      <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour; 
        cook and stir until slightly toasted fragrance, about 2 minutes. 
        Whisk in enough milk to reach desired consistency; simmer until 
        thickened, whisking constantly, 2 minutes. Stir in processed 
        cheese cubes until melted and smooth, stirring often.</li>
      <li>Unroll pizza crust; place on the prepared baking sheet. Spread 
        about 3/4 cup cheese sauce on crust. Stir cooked macaroni into 
        remaining cheese sauce; spoon onto crust in an even layer. 
        Sprinkle pizza with mozzarella cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned and 
        mozzarella is golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
